            BIM will give you tools to manage and track your design process. You'll be able to revise models to track the progress of the designs. Every member of your teams will have their communication all in one place, as well as documents and photos that they use. You'll be able to communicate with every member of your team and any other companies that you require to work with.
            <br/><br/> 
            Designing in 3D will allow you to fit your designs in to a real world setting and visualise how the design would work in the real world. This will allow you find and solve issue's with the design before it becomes an issue. If there is a clash within the design you'll be able to highlight it and solve it without having to call a meeting to disscuss what to do.
            <br/><br/>
            Using the tasks function you'll be able to create and assign tasks to your team as well as receive tasks from your client. This will create an online digital workflow and make tracking the progress of each task and sub tasks easier.

              BIM will help you to manage your site. All your data, drawings, photos, tasks, checklists, diaries and more will be stored and accessible on a mobile device. You'll be able to access everything you need and submit data without going back to the office. 
                <br/><br/>                  
              Sharing information and communicating with your client, designer, supply chain and team will be a few taps away. Your design will be handed to you in 3D, you'll be able to see what you're creating in a real world and safe view, be able to communicate and discuss ideas with your team and store your data against a model element. It'll remain there forever and won't be moved or lost in the process of the project or at the hand back stage. 
                <br/><br/> 
              The hand back process will no longer be such a manual task. Storing information in a BIM environment results in all the data being stored and organised in the same place. This means that when it comes to handing back that data all that needs to be done is for the customer to be added to the project. Alternatively if they do require a hand back of the information in a PDF form, that can be created with a few clicks as all the data is stored in one single database.

            BIM will store all the data you need to keep track of your building. Every element is accounted for in a 3D model with data attached to it informing you of every step of its lifecycle.
            <br/><br/>
            If a scenario in which an element of the facility is damaged or is deemed faulty the BIM model will allow you to select the individual part and gain all the information available for it. For example if it was a light bulb that needed replacing, the same light bulb can be selected within the BIM model and the information for that bulb can be pulled up. This would include where it was manufactured and who by, including the install date, the company who installed it, the checks that were carried out, the design used, the warranty, the maintenance contractor and their details and the expected lifetime. Having all this information in one place will allow you to manage and organise your facility more efficiently. In this situation you have all the information needed to organise a repair.
            <br/><br/> 
            Throughout the lifecycle of the project more and more data can be added to the model as it is changed, upgraded and maintained. All the information will forever be stored against the model which reduces the risk of data loss and makes organisation automatic.

            All this information will be shared with your team which will mean that you’ll be able to view all up to date information in the same place. You’ll be able to create and assign tasks and track the progress of the work to be completed. 
            <br/><br/>
            BIM allows your team to store high quality photos in one online place. These photos cannot only be named but they can also have comments attached to them as well as tags and locations. This means that the photos stored in BIM have more information and detail. The way in which BIM stores photos means that your team will be able to use them in a much more effective way when creating their bid.
            <br/><br/>
            Information that is stored in BIM can be searched for and found in a few seconds. As the data is organised and stored in a logical and free capacity, your team can choose to look for items using a folder structure or via an automatic search function. As this search function is online and uses online tools it means that it is much faster than a native conventional digital method such as Windows Explorer Search. This will greatly speed up your team’s working day allowing them to access and share information that they need within seconds instead of having to manually search or share it. When using BIM email notifications are used to inform all team members when new information is available

              Using a 3D model means that you'll be able to attach your programme to each element within the model. Then you can simulate the works to your plan and ensure its safe and efficient. When you make a change, the schedule is automatically updated along with the model.
              <br/><br/>
              By attaching your schedule to a 3D model we’ll be able animate the method of works. Each element that is created, removed, deconstructed, moved or constructed on site will be simulated using the 3D model. This will allow us to foresee and check any potential planning issues which will save time, money and improve safety. We’ll also be able to run clash detections on the movements of vehicles and materials which will ensure that your schedule is accurate and feasible in a completely risk free and safe environment.
              <br/><br/>
              All the information needed to create your schedule is stored in the Common Data Environment. Anything new will be shared with you instantly and automatically via the system. You can break down the task of creating a schedule into smaller tasks in order to manage, track and organise your work. These tasks can then be assigned to other members of your team. All the data is shared within the online environment which will allow a fluid movement of information.

              You’ll be able to access and share all the data using an online sharing platform known as a Common Data Environment (CDE). You’ll be able to use BIM while you create your bid using the CDE to share and store all your data. Your manager will be able to assign tasks to you and you’ll be able to attach photos, comments and documents so that everyone can keep track of the information being created. If there’s an issue you’ll be able to raise it and attach it to the task, creating a workflow and a dialogue with your manager. 
              <br/><br/>
              Using the 3D models you’ll be able to demonstrate the models that we’ve created as well as the data behind them providing a visual display of the work we can achieve.

              BIM will help you to manage your site. All your data, drawings, photos, tasks, checklists, diaries and more will be stored and accessible on a mobile device. You'll be able to access everything you need and submit data without going back to the office. 
                <br/><br/>                  
              Sharing information and communicating with your client, designer, supply chain and team will be a few taps away. Your design will be handed to you in 3D, you'll be able to see what you're creating in a real world and safe view, be able to communicate and discuss ideas with your team and store your data against a model element. It'll remain there forever and won't be moved or lost in the process of the project or at the hand back stage. 
                <br/><br/> 
              The hand back process will no longer be such a manual task. Storing information in a BIM environment results in all the data being stored and organised in the same place. This means that when it comes to handing back that data, all that needs to be done is for the customer to be added to the project. Alternatively if they do require a hand back of the information in a PDF form that can be created with a few clicks as all the data is stored in one single database.

              A fundamental of the BIM environment is the Common Data Environment (CDE). This is a digital online storage space in which all files, models and documents are shared. The system can be accessed from any device with browser and is also available as an app. The CDE allows for folders but also managed revisions. If a file is added which has the same name as an existing file, a revision process is enforced. Depending on the user's settings an email will be sent to all your team when a new document is added. 
              <br/><br/>
              Your team will be able to assign tasks to each other ensuring that everything is tracked. Documents can be assigned to tasks as well as issues. This allows any task or issue that is related to a document to be tracked and means that changes, annotations or comments can be attached to the document in question.

Your team of Quantity Surveyors will be able to work in an environment where all the information is shared with the right people at the right time. You’ll have access to everything, from site photos and site information to day to day numbers. 
              <br/><br/>
              Dashboards and automatic emails are able to give you breakdowns of the numbers how you want them. BIM will be able to give you the tools to see all the information you need on all your projects giving you more time to spot and stop potential issues and manage your team.

              By implementing BIM across your business unit, you’ll be able to give your team the tools to improve the way they work and digitalise the information that they build. Having all this data captured in an electronic way will allow you to see and compare it all, identify trends and make better decisions based on the information you have. By capturing and organising all this data in this format your team will have more time to carry out the more important tasks, letting BIM do all the leg work. This means that eventually your teams will be able to take on more work, reduce risk, improve safety and improve efficiency. 
              <br/><br/>
              Using BIM will give your unit extra ammunition when it comes to bidding for jobs. You’ll be able to use the BIM tools to explain and convince your customers that you’re the right company for the job. Not only does this way of working improve lives but it also increases efficiency. By being able to simulate any situation and ensure that methodology’s are feasible and safe before they go to site, we reduce the risk of someone getting hurt and a waste of our resources.

              Using 3D design and BIM for temporary works creates an opportunity to trail all your solutions in a completely risk free environment. By creating your temporary works model within a 3D model of the existing works, you’ll be able to simulate how it would fit in the real world, how it would react in the real word and how to it would be erected or installed in the real world. Solving any issues that may have occurred at a later date which may have cost time and money.
              <br/><br/>
              Using the tasks functionality you’ll be able to manage and allocate tasks and track the work complete within your team. You’ll also be able to use the tasks to record and monitor ITP’s related to your temporary works on site. Using the tasks you’ll be able to organise and manage the individual ITP. By the end of the project each one will have all the attached information required, including QA checklists, ITP data, photos and drawings. 
              <br/><br/>
              Checklists can be used to record any sort of data. Within the temporary works role they’ll be used to ensure that the works have been completed as according to the design. The QA process will be set up and tracked using these checklists which will capture the information digitally including photos, comments, issues and documents. Once a checklist is complete and the synch button is selected, the data is shared with everyone who needs it, no more waiting for someone in the site office to photocopy and email a piece of paper; this method of work will speed up the entire process.

You’ll be able to analyses the data that BIM captures from every one of your sites and identify trends that could ensure your people stay safe. Using BIM will also ensure that your company is using the best top of the range technology to complete their work. Your customers will be able to access the information that you provide in a much better and organised way. Collaboration with other companies will be made easier, with all your data being stored in once place allowing the companies you work with access to it is easy. 
              <br/><br/>
              Working in a BIM environment means that the technology does all the leg work. This means that your people are free to do the real stuff. It also means that they’ll be able get through the day of tasks quicker. We tend to spend a lot of time looking for data, with everything in once place that won’t be a problem. With data being more accessible means that the guys on the ground will have more time to do what they do, instead of trekking back to the office to do more printing.
              <br/><br/>
              Adopting BIM will give your company an extra edge when it comes to bidding for work. Displaying to your customers that you’re able to work in a collaborative environment which benefits them will improve your chances of winning more work. Creating a bid that includes benefits that you can offer such as Electronic Data Capture, Model Simulations and much more will demonstrate what you’re willing to do in order to make the clients life easier throughout and at the end of the project.
